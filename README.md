# DistributedSystems

This repository contains the solutions to the homework assignments for the course **Distributed Systems**, covering a range of topics such as sockets, REST, actor model, middleware, message-oriented middleware (MOM), and ZooKeeper.

- [**Lab1: Socket Programming**](./Lab1/)

  The Lab1 directory contains the solution to the socket programming homework assignment. In this assignment, students were required to implement a simple chat application using sockets. The solution includes a server program and a client program written in the Java language.

- [**Lab2: REST API**](./Lab2/)

  The Lab2 directory contains the solution to the REST API homework assignment. In this assignment, students were tasked with implementing a simple REST API. The solution includes a server program written in the Go language.

- [**Lab3: Actor Model**](./Lab3/)

  The Lab3 directory contains the solution to the actor model homework assignment using the Ray framework. Students were expected to explore the actor model paradigm and apply it to a distributed system. The solution demonstrates the implementation using the Ray framework and Python language.

- [**Lab4-5: Middleware**](./Lab4-5)

  The Lab4-5 directory contains the solution to the middleware homework assignment using various middleware technologies such as Apache Thrift, Ice, and gRPC. Students were challenged to design and implement a distributed system using these middleware technologies written in Java and Python languages.

- [**Lab6: Message Oriented Middleware**](./Lab6)

  The Lab6 directory contains the solution to the message-oriented middleware (MOM) homework assignment using RabbitMQ. Students were required to develop a system that utilizes RabbitMQ as the messaging middleware to enable communication between distributed components. The solution is written in the Go language.

- [**Lab7: Zookeeper**](./Lab7)

  The Lab7 directory contains the solution to the ZooKeeper homework assignment. In this assignment, students were tasked with creating a Java application using the distributed, replicated ZooKeeper environment and its watch mechanism. The solution demonstrates the implementation of a distributed system leveraging ZooKeeper.
